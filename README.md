Intrigued by pathfinding algorithms? This interactive web application brings **Dijkstra's**, **Depth-First Search (DFS)**, and **Breadth-First Search (BFS)** algorithms to life, letting you visualize their journey on customizable grids. Whether you're a seasoned developer, a curious student, or simply fascinated by problem-solving, this tool is for you!

##### Why You'll Love This Visualizer:

- _Interactive Playground:_ Craft your own pathfinding challenges. Define obstacles, set start and end points, and adjust grid size to experiment with different scenarios.
- _Algorithm Showcase:_ Witness the inner workings of Dijkstra's, DFS, and BFS algorithms firsthand. See how they explore the grid, evaluate options, and ultimately guide you to the solution.
- _Engaging Visualization:_ Clear color-coding and animations highlight explored nodes, path sections, obstacles, and more, making the process dynamic and easy to understand.
- _Simple Navigation:_ Intuitive controls and a user-friendly interface ensure you spend less time learning the tool and more time exploring pathfinding magic.

##### Dive into the Tech Stack:

- **ReactJS:** Powers the dynamic and interactive user interface, allowing for smooth interactions and visual updates.
- **JavaScript/Typescript:** Implements the core pathfinding algorithms and grid logic, bringing the theoretical concepts to life.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Provides a clean and responsive layout through its utility-first approach, ensuring the app looks great on any device.
